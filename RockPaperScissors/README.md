# RockPaperScissors Project 
This is a simple app I created following the requirements of Day 25 of 100 Days of SwiftUI. This isn't a tutorial app, but a challenge day with the app being made from scratch on my end. The application will randomly select either Rock, Paper, or Scissors. It will then randomly select "Win" or "Lose", and proceed to ask the user which option listed would either win or lose based on the randomly selected option. It's meant to be a brain teaser for the user.

## Rules/Requirements given by 100 Days of SwiftUI 

So, very roughly:

1. Each turn of the game the app will randomly pick either rock, paper, or scissors.
2. Each turn the app will alternate between prompting the player to win or lose.
3. The player must then tap the correct move to win or lose the game.
4. If they are correct they score a point; otherwise they lose a point.
5. The game ends after 10 questions, at which point their score is shown.
6. So, if the app chose “Rock” and “Win” the player would need to choose “Paper”, but if the app chose “Rock” and “Lose” the player would need to choose “Scissors”.
